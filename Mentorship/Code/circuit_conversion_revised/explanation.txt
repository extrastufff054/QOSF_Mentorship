The approach currently discussed uses a single quantum circuit for the entire word, 
with each character being encoded into a separate qubit within that circuit. 
Hereâ€™s a brief explanation:

Single Circuit for the Word: The quantum circuit is created with a number of qubits equal to the length of the word.
Each qubit in the circuit represents one character from the word.
Encoding: Each character is encoded as an angle and then used to apply a rotation gate (RY) to the corresponding qubit.
Decoding: The quantum states are measured, and the angles are used to decode back into characters to retrieve the original word.
The intent is to encode the entire word in one go and retrieve it later using the same circuit setup.

Clarification:
Circuit per Character: Each character has its own qubit within the same circuit.
Circuit per Word: One quantum circuit is used for the entire word, with multiple qubits corresponding to each character.
